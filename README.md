# Excel-Machine-Learning

The PDF shows how to construct and train a neural network using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets with a simple mathematical example. It aims to introduce the audiences (with no programming requirements) the key concepts of machine learning by demonstrating the internal calculations involved. After the exercise, participant will understand the mechanisms of dataset, model architecture, weights, loss function, model training, and model deployment. This approach is educational and not a substitute for established machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
