# Excel-Machine-Learning

Please find the PDF that shows how to construct and train a neural network using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets with a simple mathematical example. It aims to introduce the audiences (with no programming requirements) the key concepts of machine learning by demonstrating the internal calculations involved. After the excercise, participant will understand dataset, model architecture, weights, loss function, model training, and model deployment. The approach is educational and not a substitute for established machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
